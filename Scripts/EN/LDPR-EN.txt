Our Father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth, as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those
who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory
Forever and forever
Amen!
