Our Mother who art in our Hearts
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth, as it is in Heaven
Give us this day Thy divine vibrations
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those
Who trespass against us
And lead us not into Maya
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the Father
The Children and the Glory
Forever and Ever
Amen!
